# Things To Do - File Transfer System Enhancements

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Large File Buffer Overflow Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Host-Client Coordination Protocol
- [ ] **Add CLIENT_READY Message Type**
  - [ ] Add CLIENT_READY to MESSAGE_TYPES in fileTransferUtils.ts
  - [ ] Define CLIENT_READY message structure with transferId
  - [ ] Add CLIENT_READY to binary protocol encoding/decoding
  - [ ] Update message handler to process CLIENT_READY messages

- [ ] **Client-Side Ready Signal**
  - [ ] Send CLIENT_READY after successful initializeStorage() completion
  - [ ] Only send CLIENT_READY for large files using File System Access API
  - [ ] Include transferId in CLIENT_READY message for proper routing
  - [ ] Handle CLIENT_READY send failures gracefully

- [ ] **Host-Side Coordination Logic**
  - [ ] Add waitForClientReady() function in useFileTransferCore.ts
  - [ ] Implement CLIENT_READY message listener on host side
  - [ ] Add timeout for CLIENT_READY (recommended: 60 seconds)
  - [ ] Only wait for CLIENT_READY when sending large files (≥100MB)

- [ ] **File Transfer Flow Updates**
  - [ ] Modify sendFile() to wait for CLIENT_READY before sending chunks
  - [ ] Add conditional waiting: only for large files with File System Access
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility for small files (<100MB)
  - [ ] Add proper error handling if CLIENT_READY timeout occurs

### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Protocol Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add CLIENT_READY = 0x05 to MESSAGE_TYPES
  - [ ] Update encodeBinaryMessage/decodeBinaryMessage for new message type
  - [ ] Add CLIENT_READY handler in fileTransferMessageHandlers.ts
  - [ ] Create sendClientReady() utility function

- [ ] **Conditional Logic**
  - [ ] Check if file is large (≥100MB) AND using File System Access API
  - [ ] Skip coordination for small files (use existing immediate flow)
  - [ ] Skip coordination if no File System Access API (memory storage)
  - [ ] Only apply coordination where buffer overflow can actually occur

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Large File Scenarios**
  - [ ] Test 1GB+ files with File System Access API
  - [ ] Verify no buffer overflow during user file picker dialog
  - [ ] Test CLIENT_READY timeout scenarios (user takes too long)
  - [ ] Validate that small files still work without coordination

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Test CLIENT_READY message loss/corruption
  - [ ] Test multiple simultaneous large file transfers
  - [ ] Test browser refresh during file picker dialog
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation on CLIENT_READY timeout

### Belt & Suspenders: Simple Buffer Safety Limit
- [ ] **Add Defensive Buffer Limit**
  - [ ] Add MAX_PENDING_CHUNKS = 50 constant (~3.2MB at 64KB chunks)
  - [ ] Check buffer size before adding chunks to pendingChunksRef
  - [ ] Throw clear error message on buffer overflow
  - [ ] Add buffer size to error context for debugging

- [ ] **Implementation Details**
  - [ ] Add buffer check in fileTransferMessageHandlers.ts handleFileChunk()
  - [ ] Use descriptive error: "Buffer overflow: too many pending chunks during initialization"
  - [ ] Include transferId, fileName, and current buffer size in error
  - [ ] Log buffer overflow attempts for monitoring

- [ ] **Safety Testing**
  - [ ] Test buffer limit with artificially slow initialization
  - [ ] Verify error message clarity and actionability
  - [ ] Test that buffer limit doesn't affect normal operation
  - [ ] Validate buffer limit protects against memory exhaustion

## 🔄 Adaptive Chunking Resumption Gap (PERFORMANCE ISSUE)

### Missing Chunk Manager State Restoration
- [ ] **Add Chunk Manager State Restoration Methods**
  - [ ] Add setChunkSize() method to adaptiveChunkManager
  - [ ] Add setNetworkContext() method to restore previous network learning
  - [ ] Add restoreOptimizationState() method for complete state restoration
  - [ ] Preserve network quality metrics and RTT measurements across sessions

- [ ] **Modify Transfer Resumption Logic**
  - [ ] Update useFileTransferCore resumption to restore chunk manager state
  - [ ] Call chunkManager.setChunkSize(resumedState.chunkSize) during resume
  - [ ] Restore network context from persisted state (RTT, bandwidth, quality)
  - [ ] Ensure resumed transfers immediately use optimal chunk sizes

- [ ] **Performance Optimization Implementation**
  - [ ] Prevent chunk size re-learning on transfer resumption
  - [ ] Maintain network adaptation context across browser sessions
  - [ ] Test that resumed large file transfers maintain optimal throughput
  - [ ] Validate that chunk size optimization is preserved after crashes

### Current Gap Analysis
- [ ] **What Works**: Chunk progress and network metrics are saved to persistence
- [ ] **What's Missing**: Adaptive chunk manager starts fresh on resumption (64KB default)
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: 30-60 seconds of sub-optimal performance during re-learning
- [ ] **Solution**: Restore chunk manager to previously learned optimal state
